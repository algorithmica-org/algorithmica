In 1940, a British mathematician [G. H. Hardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy) published a famous essay titled "[A Mathematician's Apology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician%27s_Apology)" discussing the notion that mathematics should be pursued for its own sake rather than for the sake of its applications.

Similar to mathematics, the various fields of computer science also form a spectrum, with mathematical logic and computability theory on one end and web programming and application development on the other. I assume that you, the reader, is more on the applied side: this book was written to show that there are way too few people working on practical algorithm design instead of theoretical computer science — and since you got to Chapter 7, you probably also believe in that statement.

But, regardless of the personal views on the matter, one can see where Hardy is coming from. Being 62 years old at the date of writing, he witnessed the devastation caused by the First and the ongoing Second World War — which was greatly amplified by the weaponization of science. As a number theorist, Hardy finds calm working in a "useless" field and not having to face any moral dilemmas, writing:

> No one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems unlikely that anyone will do so for many years.

Ironically, this statement was proved very wrong just 5 years later with the development of the atomic bomb, which would not have been possible without the [understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Szil%C3%A1rd_letter) of relativity, and the inception of computer-era cryptography, which extensively builds on number theory — the computational aspect of which is the main topic of this chapter.

One can find calm in pursuing "useless" math and not having to face any moral dilemmas.

Hardy seems somewhat gratified that his own field has no applications:

A scientist faces a moral dilemma because some of their inventions may do more harm than good. One may find calm in pursing "useless" math.

Hardy seems to find calm in pursuing "useless" math and not having to face any moral dilemmas:

Scientists often face a moral dilemma because some of their inventions may do more harm than good.

One can find calm in pursuing "useless" math and not facing any moral dilemmas. Hardy seems somewhat gratified that his own field has no applications:

If your field has no applications, you don't have to face any moral dilemmas — and Hardy seems to be his own field, number theory, has none:

somewhat proudly pointing out that his field has no practical applications:

A scientist faces a moral dilemma because some of its inventions may do more harm than good. One can find calm in pursuing useless math. Hardy himself specialized in number theory, and he was content about it not having any applications:

It is ironic that within just 5 years number theory was the basis of cracking Enigma and relativity theory developing atomic bomb respectively.

Number theory has many more applications.
