Algorithmica is an open-access web book dedicated to the art and science of computing.

It is created by [Sergey Slotin](http://sereja.me/) and the teachers and students of [Tinkoff Generation](https://fintech.tinkoff.ru/study/generation/) â€” a nonprofit educational organization that trains about half of the finalists of the Russian Olympiad in Informatics.

The English version of the website is a work in progress; the only useful thing you can find here is the continuously updated draft of [Algorithms for Modern Hardware](hpc). We are currently more focused on [the Russian version](https://ru.algorithmica.org/), which hosts various course materials that we use ourselves.

If you spot an error, please create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/algorithmica-org/algorithmica) or, preferably, fix it right away (the pencil icon on the top-right).
